# RL_Mountain_Car_Control
Classic control problem solved by various RL algorithm to compare results.

Q: This is a classical problem and it will be interesting to see your implementation! It is unclear at this stage how you will represent the problem for the different techniques you are planning to use. Could you provide more details?  

A: To answer this question, we need to describe the state representation. SARSA and Q-learning require state discretization. We can use fixed interval to represent states due to limited number of states. DQN and REINFORCE need continuous state representation, which is what we have. We need to mention this detail in our report.
